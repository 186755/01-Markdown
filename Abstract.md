I have researched into the contents of milk and its nutrient value for humans.  I want to promote the benifits that milk offers and encourage people to include more dairy products in their diet.  I plan on providing charts in the paper to illistrate how much milk will contribute to daily nutritional requirements.  Overall, milk is amazing and everyone needs it.
