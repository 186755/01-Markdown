I will be writing about the issue on milk labeling.  I am in agreement of taking the "milk" label off of almond, soy, pea, and other products associated with the word milk.  This needs to be changed becuase milk itself has a much higher nutritional value than the other products and many people may not know that.  My call to action is drink more milk!
